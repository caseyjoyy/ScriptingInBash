# Project 02 - Scripting in Bash
In this project we will apply our coding skills to pick up some low-level scripting skills in our newly acquired Git-Bash terminal using the text editor **nano**

## Basic commands used
```bash
i - Used to edit file in Vim
./ [filename] - used to run file in terminal
:help [keyword] - Performs a search of help documentation for whatever keyword you enter
:w - Saves the file you are working on
:w [filename] - Allows you to save your file with the name you've defined
:wq - Save your file and close Vim
:q! - Quit without first saving the file you were working on

```
## The process I took
I simply followed along during the tutorial that was given. I used the vim that comes installed in the mac terminal, so that helped. In addition, I cd into my repo when making all of the **.sh** files. Finally, I then used VS code to edit the README that your reading now and to push all of the files to GitHub üòÑ

## What worked for me and what did not
While going through the tutorial, everything worked that I could notice. One small thing I had to change was when making comparison the space matters. Example Below ‚¨áÔ∏è
 ```bash
 [ $string_a = $string_b ]
 ```

# Code Review Casey Marotta
 ### Comments:
- Code is very well organized and easy to follow. The logic flows very well.
- Since I'm not familiar with python, it was interesting to see the different syntax and operators.
- All the indentions looked good, the only thing I could recommend is possibly adding additional comments to help someone who is not familiar with python for example, more comments on syntax being used in each function.
